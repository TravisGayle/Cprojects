For part 3 of the lab, I had to think of a formula that was not trivial.
Since I worked at a hedge fund this past summer, I saw it necessary to
do something along the lines of taxes. From the perspective of the user,
the program is meant to calculate the tax that the user has to pay,
along with the grand total based on numerous inputs. If the user entered
a negative subtotal an error message would display. From the perspective
of a programmer, an input would be entered, then scanned, following two
lines of calculations whose results displayed based on the final lines
of code. I had a few problems getting the code to work in the beginning.
The inputs would be entered and everything would return as 0. I finally
solved the problem by adding the “&” sign before the variable in the
scanning portions. My problem was solved, and to check I used a entered
inputs, calculated the results and matched it to a calculator for
verification.
