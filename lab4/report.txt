Lab#4 Part 3 Report

From the user perspective:

The user is prompted to pick a number that corresponds to a different question.
If the user picks an option between 1 and 4, the user is prompted with either
more information or is requested for more number picking--in this case, the
year. If another option is picked, the user exits and is no longer prompted.

From the internal perspective:

The program has 4 conditions in which if none are met, the program is exited.
Based on the numbers that are inputted, the program reads that number and 
proceeds. Because the assignment asked us to do so, we created functions 
and the program called these functions. The purpose of doing so was so that 
the lines of codes could be reduced and so that if the program wanted to use
a portion of code again, it could be called easily.

Verifying Program Correctness:

In other words, how accurate was my program and how was the accuracy calculated?
The program was accurate. In order to check results, I input a value as the user
and checked to see if years or records corresponded between program based data
and actual data already stored on the internet.
