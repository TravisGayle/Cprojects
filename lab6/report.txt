Lab #6 Report

From the user perspective, the program is very interactive. It first asks the user to enter the file 
that it wants to display. From there on, the awesomeness occurs. The user is offered a list	
of options to choose from. The user can choose to have the information within the file displayed,
the user can add a word to the list of words, the user can search for a word or phrase or even 
character like a regular computer function would with control f, the user can save the information
to a new file, and the user can print the information of the file in reverse order. I can already
tell that the user likes this program. From the perspective of the computer, it asks the user
for the file name and then the computer reads it in. Once read in, the program places each string, 
which is nothing but an array of characters into an array based on the amount of memory we 
allocated to that array. The end result is an array of an array of strings OR an array of
characters OR a two dimensional array. Furthermore, based on what the user enters, the program
goes into different cases to perform an action such adding the new phrase to the list of
already existing arrays. To verify that the output of the program was correct, I ran it multiple 
times to test the different cases. I experienced many errors at first, but finally got my
program to work. I also checked to see that the newfile was in my directory and that it contained the 
correct or expected information after that new file was created.
